# Fides Stats

This repo is responsible for continually snapshotting statistics for all of the main Fides projects and then moving that data into our internal datawarehouse. This is neccessary to get around GitHub's inability to save more than 14 days worth of analytics.

This repo is based off of: https://github.com/jgehrcke/github-repo-stats
